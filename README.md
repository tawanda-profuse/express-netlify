# Express Netlify

*An Express JS app that runs on Netlify*

This repository is not a production project but it is a project to help me to practice how to use Express JS and deploying such apps on the Netlify platform. You can, however use the functions in this repository for a production build. 

### Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### Netlify Lambda
Netlify Lambda is an optional tool that helps with building or locally developing Netlify Functions with a simple webpack/babel build step. It makes it easy to write Lambda's with transpiled JS/TypeScript features and imported modules.

### Serverless Http
Serverless Http is a module that allows you to 'wrap' your API for serverless use. There is no need for an HTTP server, ports or sockets. The code can run in the same execution pipeline.

- `Build Command: npm run build`
- `Publish Directory: dist`
