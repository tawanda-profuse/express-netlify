# Express Netlify

*An Express JS app that runs on Netlify*

This repository is not a production project but it is a project to help me to practice how to use Express JS and deploying such apps on the Netlify platform. You can, however use the functions in this repository for a production build.

- `Build Command: npm run build`
- `Publish Directory: dist`
